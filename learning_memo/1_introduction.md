# Introduction for 'Learning Memo'

## What is this memo for?

This is a daily records of development of this backend system.

I am Japanese speaker and some of these sentences would be awkward or strange, but I write this records in English so that as many people as possible could understand what I have thought and done during development. It is also because it is fun to make sentences in English for me ;-)

I am trying to develop this backend system with Go, but I am new to the language and this is my first backend system uploaded on GitHub.
Therefore, I decided to record my trajectory of learning about Go and backend systems, so that I could remember about this important development experience and so that this could be help for future development.
